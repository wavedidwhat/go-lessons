# ðŸ—“ Week 1 â€” Go Basics, Packages & Imports

Welcome to Week 1! This week is your launchpad into the world of Go programming. We're not just learning syntax â€” we're *thinking in Go*. This means building intuition around Go's unique style and design principles, and practicing every single day to make these concepts second nature. Get ready to dive deep, experiment boldly, and set a strong foundation for your coding journey!

## Goal for the Week

By the end of this week, you'll have a solid grasp of Go's fundamental building blocks, understand how to organize your code using packages and imports, and be comfortable navigating Goâ€™s project structure. You'll be writing clean, idiomatic Go code and thinking like a Go developer.

## Overview

- Mastering Go syntax and core constructs  
- Declaring and using variables, constants, and types  
- Writing functions and controlling program flow with conditionals and loops  
- Organizing your code with packages and imports  
- Exploring Goâ€™s project structure and workspace conventions  
- Getting hands-on with Go tools and documentation  

## Mindset for the Week

Approach this week with energy and curiosity. Donâ€™t just memorizeâ€”*experiment* and *explore*. Push yourself to try new things, break your code, and fix it again. Read the official Go documentation with intent and think about why Go works the way it does. Embrace Go idioms early and build habits that will make you a confident, efficient Go programmer. Let's get started!

# Week 1 â€” Daily Tasks

## Day 1: Introduction to Go

- **Focus:** Setting up Go environment, understanding Go syntax basics
- **Build:** Write a simple "Hello, World!" program
- **Concepts:** Go installation, `main` package, `func main()`, printing output
- **Challenge:** Modify the program to print your name
- **Resources:** Official Go installation guide, "Getting Started" tutorial

## Day 2: Variables, Constants, and Types

- **Focus:** Declaring variables and constants, exploring basic types
- **Build:** Create a program that declares variables of different types and prints them
- **Concepts:** `var`, `const`, type inference, basic types (int, float, string, bool)
- **Challenge:** Experiment with zero values and type conversions
- **Resources:** Go Tour: Basics, Effective Go: Variables

## Day 3: Functions and Control Flow

- **Focus:** Writing functions, using if/else and loops
- **Build:** Write functions to perform simple calculations and use control flow to handle logic
- **Concepts:** Function declaration, parameters, return values, `if`, `for` loops
- **Challenge:** Implement a function that checks if a number is prime
- **Resources:** Go Tour: Flow control, Effective Go: Functions

## Day 4: Arrays, Slices, and Maps

- **Focus:** Working with collections
- **Build:** Create and manipulate arrays, slices, and maps
- **Concepts:** Array and slice syntax, map declaration and usage
- **Challenge:** Write a program that counts word frequency in a slice of strings
- **Resources:** Go Tour: More types, Go by Example: Maps

## Day 5: Structs and Methods

- **Focus:** Defining structs and associated methods
- **Build:** Model a simple data structure like a `Person` and add methods
- **Concepts:** Structs, method receivers, pointer vs value receivers
- **Challenge:** Extend the `Person` struct with methods to update and display information
- **Resources:** Effective Go: Methods, Go by Example: Structs

## Day 6: Packages and Imports

- **Focus:** Organizing code into packages, importing standard and custom packages
- **Build:** Create your own package and import it into the main program
- **Concepts:** Package declaration, import paths, exported vs unexported identifiers
- **Challenge:** Refactor previous code into packages and use imports
- **Resources:** Go Blog: Packages, Effective Go: Package names

## Day 7: Review and Reflection

- **Focus:** Review all concepts, practice exercises, and reflect on learning
- **Build:** Complete a mini-project combining all learned concepts
- **Concepts:** Integration of syntax, packages, and project structure
- **Challenge:** Build a CLI tool that uses functions, structs, and packages
- **Resources:** Go Playground, Go documentation
