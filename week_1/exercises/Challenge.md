## 🧩 Daily Challenges (check as you complete)

- [ ] **Day 1:** Declare variables of different types (int, float, string, bool) and print them using `fmt.Println`.  
- [ ] **Day 2:** Write a function that takes an integer and returns whether it’s even or odd.  
- [ ] **Day 3:** Organize your code into **two packages** and import them correctly in `main.go`.  
- [ ] **Day 4:** Initialize a Go module (`go mod init`) and import an external standard library package (e.g. `"math"` or `"strings"`).  
- [ ] **Day 5:** Build a small CLI tool combining constants, variables, simple functions, and at least one package you made.

## 🚀 Weekly Challenge

- [ ] **Guess My Number**  
  Create a “Guess My Number” game:
  - Generate a random number between **1 and 10**  
  - Prompt the user to guess  
  - Give hints (“higher” / “lower”)  
  - End when correct  
  - (Hint: import `"math/rand"` and `"time"` for randomness)

### 🔍 Optional stretch ideas (for bonus practice)
- [ ] Seed the random number generator so the game is unpredictable across runs.  
- [ ] Limit the number of guesses (e.g. 5 tries) and display score.  
- [ ] Allow the user to play multiple rounds in a loop.  
- [ ] Add “restart” option after finishing one round.

> 📝 Tip: Use Go’s standard library utilities like `fmt.Scanln`, `time.Now().UnixNano()`, and error checking to make your code robust.
