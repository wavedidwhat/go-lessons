package constants

//let's create a constant for various things, we start with username (who is this user)
const userName = "wavedidwhat" //try exporting this variable to see what happens

// check the notes.md file to see what happened when you export that const above

const Username = "wave"

const Age = 20


const Publicusername = userName //This will make sense when you see the main.go file
