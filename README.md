## 🤖 AI Tools — Your Learning Companion

Using AI-powered tools such as **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** is **encouraged** throughout your journey! These tools can accelerate your learning by offering instant explanations, code suggestions, and debugging help.

**Remember:** AI is a powerful assistant, but true mastery comes from deeply understanding *why* and *how* things work. Use AI to complement your problem-solving skills, not replace them.

---

## 💡 Philosophy

This journey emphasizes **practicality and idiomatic Go**. You’ll learn not just to write code, but to write *good* Go code — clean, efficient, and maintainable. Projects and exercises are designed to reflect real-world scenarios, preparing you for professional development.

---

## 🎯 By the End of This Journey

You will be able to:

- Write idiomatic and robust Go code.
- Understand and implement concurrency patterns.
- Build and test web services using Go’s standard library.
- Use Go tools for debugging and performance tuning.
- Develop full-stack Go applications integrating databases and APIs.
- Confidently use AI tools as learning and productivity aids.
